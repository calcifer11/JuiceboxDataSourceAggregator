# Data Aggregator Contracts for Collecting Allow Lists and Weights

üëã Welcome to the Data Aggregator Contracts repository! This project provides example Solidity contracts that demonstrate the aggregation of allow lists and weights from multiple sources. These contracts are designed to simplify the process of collecting and processing data from various sources and sending them as a single argument to a project contract.

## Features

‚úÖ **Allow List Aggregation:** The `AllowlistDataSourceAggregator` contract showcases how to aggregate allow lists from multiple data sources. It verifies if an address is allowed by iterating through the data sources and checking each individual allow list.

‚úÖ **Weight Aggregation:** The `DataWeightAggregator` contract demonstrates how to aggregate weights from multiple data sources. It calculates the average weight modifier using weighted arithmetic mean and adjusts the weight accordingly.

## Example Usage
**Allow List Aggregation**
¬¥¬¥¬¥
// Example usage of AllowlistDataSourceAggregator contract
contract MyProject {
    AllowlistDataSourceAggregator private allowlistAggregator;

    constructor(address[] memory dataSources) {
        // Deploy the AllowlistDataSourceAggregator contract
        allowlistAggregator = new AllowlistDataSourceAggregator();

        // Initialize the aggregator with data sources
        allowlistAggregator.initialize(projectId, directory, deployMyDelegateData);
    }

    function processPayment(address payer) public {
        // Check if the payer is allowed using the allow list aggregator
        bool isAllowed = allowlistAggregator.isAllowed(payer);

        // Process the payment based on the allow list result
        // ...
    }
}

**Weight Aggregation**
¬¥¬¥¬¥
// Example usage of DataWeightAggregator contract
contract MyProject {
    DataWeightAggregator private weightAggregator;

    constructor(address[] memory dataSources) {
        // Deploy the DataWeightAggregator contract
        weightAggregator = new DataWeightAggregator();

        // Add data sources to the aggregator
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < dataSources.length; i++) {
            weightAggregator.addDataSources(dataSources[i]);
        }
    }

    function adjustWeight(uint256 baseWeight) public view returns (uint256 adjustedWeight) {
        // Get the adjusted weight using the weight aggregator
        adjustedWeight = weightAggregator.calculateAdjustedWeight(baseWeight);

        return adjustedWeight;
    }
}

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd data-aggregator-contracts`
3. Install Forge with `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`. If you already have Foundry installed, run `foundryup` to update to the latest version. More detailed instructions can be found in the [Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
4. Follow the instructions in the [Yarn Docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). People tend to use the latest version of Yarn 1 (not Yarn 2+).
5. Deploy the contracts to your preferred Ethereum development network.
6. Interact with the deployed contracts by calling their functions.
